                        <h3>Welcome to LEGENDS International School, Lalmatia, Dhaka!</h3>
                        <p style="text-align: justify">I feel immensely privileged and very respected to function as the Principal of LEGENDS International School, Dhaka. I, indeed, convey my never-ending gratitude to the Management, LEGENDS International School, Dhaka for giving me the scope to serve the community here in Lalmatia, Dhaka.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify">We, at LEGENDS International School, ensure quality education which not only motivates but also empowers the students to be eternal learners as well as productive members of the society and thereby eventually become a global citizen. LEGENDS deals education not just like a set of information that is put into a child’s brain, our mode of education is the one, too, which also caters the individual needs of our pupils.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify">We want all of our learners to achieve their full potential whereas our task is to make it happen along with our mission is to provide a sustainable platform for the same purpose.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify">Success for every student is ensured in our LEGENDS by the delivery of an enriched, child centred, balanced and structured curriculum along with holistic institutional-focus on students’ welfare which maintains the positive recognition of students’ achievements. Teachers at LEGENDS are highly qualified, well-groomed and experienced as well who are deeply committed to support each student’s learning experience through quality instruction and guidance that addresses the needs of every individual. Teachers tirelessly work to provide students with differentiated support that addresses every student’s specific needs both academically and socially.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify">I, personally believe that an education system that evolves and develops the imagination of the children is way richer. The imagination is where new ideas get generated and progressed to translate them into reality. “Imagination is more important than knowledge” because knowledge is about what we already know, whereas imagination is what evolves individuals and cultures towards positive innovation. LEGENDS would certainly provide necessary priority to imaginative as well as playful methods, especially in Kindergarten.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify">LEGENDS do ensure uncompromising safety for its students while our policies initiate the activities that actively promote safe and healthy lifestyle whereas it effectively contribute to create a sustainable conservation of our environment.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify">We do believe that the parents are the children’s first and foremost educator and thus, play a vital role in their education. Our system ensures the parents’ active participation in the education of the children where they become inseparable part of our school life. We warmly urge the parents to know the staff, especially their child’s teachers and assist wherever they can so that we can work together for the interests as well as the greater welfare of everyone. I always crave to work with our parents-community in supporting their children in their learning-process. We always strive to build strong parent-teacher relationship which is very important for the academic and other success of our students.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify">I would like the parents to know that my door is always open to discuss any concern, query, or idea you may have regarding your child’s development. I welcome you all to our outstanding learning community where everyone is dedicated to a high standard of excellence.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify">We truly have a tremendous school with a supportive and involved parent community, dedicated and highly skillful staff, well-groomed faculty, excellent resources along with fascinating buildings and the most potential students to work with. We are very sure that with the help of all the stakeholders along with their continuous support, we would obviously take our school to the next highest level of excellence. At our end, we shall continue working with you for the best interests of our beloved students, our community, and the globe at large.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify">I do commit to enthusiastically and passionately lead the school to enable LEGENDS to reach its goals and objectives. Let us work together to place LEGENDS at the top of the high ranking schools in our country by virtue of creating every member of LEGEND a Global Citizen. We look forward and welcome you to be part of our sprightly learning community.</p>
