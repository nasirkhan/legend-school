                        <h3>LEGENDS</h3>
                        <p style="text-align: justify">Legend is an O/A School registered as English Medium School with Ministry of Education of Bangladesh. It is going to follow Cambridge curriculum from Playgroup to A Level. </p>

                        <h5 style="font-weight: bold">School Leadership Style:</h5>
                        <p style="text-align: justify">The leadership style of the school would likely be transformational. This style of leadership focuses on inspiring and motivating individuals to work towards a shared vision and common goals. It emphasizes the development of each individual's potential and encourages creativity and innovation. The leader sets an example by living the school's values and mission, and fosters a positive and inclusive school culture. Transformational leaders also encourages collaboration, open communication, and continuous improvement. This approach is suitable for schools as it allows for a more democratic and collective decision-making process and creates a more engaged and motivated school community.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: bold">There are several different types of school leadership styles, including:</p>
                        <ol style="margin-left: 30px; margin-top: 20px;">
                            <li style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 10px;">1.	Autocratic leadership: This style is characterized by a leader who makes decisions independently and expects compliance from followers. This style of leadership is not suitable for schools as it does not encourage participation from the staff and student community.</li>
                            <li style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 10px;">2.	Transformational leadership: This style focuses on inspiring and motivating individuals to work towards a shared vision and common goals. It emphasizes the development of each individual's potential and encourages creativity and innovation.</li>
                            <li style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 10px;">3.	Servant leadership: This style of leadership emphasizes the leader's role in serving the needs of the students, staff, and community. The leader puts the needs of others first and focuses on creating a positive and inclusive school culture.</li>
                            <li style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 10px;">4.	Democratic leadership: This style of leadership is characterized by a leader who encourages participation and input from all members of the school community. It is suitable for schools as it allows for a more democratic and collective decision-making process and creates a more engaged and motivated school community.</li>
                            <li style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 10px;">5.	Laissez-faire leadership: This style of leadership is characterized by a leader who takes a hands-off approach, allowing individuals to make their own decisions without providing guidance or direction. This style is not suitable for schools as it does not provide the structure and direction that is necessary for a school to function effectively.</li>
                            <li style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 10px;">6.	Transformative leadership: This style is a combination of Transformational and Servant leadership where the leader focuses on empowering the team to transform themselves, the organization and the community for the better.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p style="text-align: justify">These are some common types of school leadership styles. The most effective school leaders often use a combination of styles depending on the situation and the needs of the school community.</p>

                        <ol style="margin-left: 30px; margin-top: 20px;">
                            <li style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 10px;">1.	Transformational leadership: This style would be a great fit for Legend, as it focuses on inspiring and motivating individuals to work towards a shared vision and common goals. The school's mission to produce responsible global citizens aligns well with the emphasis on personal and social responsibility and the development of each individual's potential that is central to transformational leadership.</li>
                            <li style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 10px;">2.	Servant leadership: This style of leadership aligns well with the school's vision to be a leading international school that produces graduates who are responsible global citizens. The emphasis on putting the needs of others first and creating a positive and inclusive school culture would be beneficial for the school's community and the students.</li>
                            <li style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 10px;">3.	Transformative leadership: This style combines Transformational and Servant leadership where the leader focuses on empowering the team to transform themselves, the organization and the community for the better. This approach would help the school to achieve its goal of creating global citizens and would empower the staff and students to take an active role in improving their school and their community.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p style="text-align: justify">By using a combination of these leadership styles, the school would be able to create a positive, inclusive and empowering culture that aligns well with the school's mission and vision. It would provide a more democratic and collective decision-making process and creates a more engaged and motivated school community.</p>

                        <h5 style="font-weight: bold">Pedagogical Leadership: </h5>

This person would work closely with the teachers and staff to ensure that the school's curriculum is aligned with the school's mission and vision, and that the teaching practices are evidence-based and effective in promoting student learning.

                        <p style="text-align: justify">The role of the principal at Legend School would be to provide overall leadership and direction for the school.

                        <h5 style="font-weight: bold">Some specific responsibilities of the principal would include:</h5>
                        <ol style="margin-left: 30px; margin-top: 20px;">

                        </ol>
